# Payload - Welcome 👋
Hello and thank you for visiting my GitHub! 🙌
I'm a cybersecurity and programming learner with a passion for exploring the ever-changing world of digital security. On my GitHub, you'll find my apprenticeship journey as well as my projects.
# Who I am 🤔
- 🎓 Self-taught: I learn on my own in order to progress in pentesting, malware analysis and network security.
- 🔍 Problem solver: I enjoy reverse engineering, vulnerability analysis and participating in capture-the-flag (CTF) competitions.
- 🌱 Lifelong learner: Cybersecurity is a vast field, and I'm always looking for new frameworks, tools and methodologies to expand my knowledge.
# 🔐 Cybersecurity projects
Here you'll find repositories ranging from simple tools to more advanced scripts and frameworks, including :
- **Penetration testing tools**: Python and Bash scripts developed to automate recognition, enumeration and exploitation tasks.
- **CTF essays**: Detailed descriptions of challenges I've solved, covering topics such as cryptography, steganography and Web mining.
- And more...
I'm still learning and hope to share my projects here soon.
